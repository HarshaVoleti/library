        <h2>LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p >A library is a place where a lot of books are there for reading. 
            Every school, college, and the university has its own library. 
            There are all types of books including science, literature, famous personalities, economics, commerce, etc.
             Students love to visit the library and read books.
            The prime purpose of a library is to provide access to knowledge and information. 
            To fulfil this mission, libraries preserve a valuable record of culture. 
            Then they pass down this to the coming generations. Therefore, 
            they are an essential link between the past, present and future. 
            People use libraries to work. They also use library resources to learn about personal interests. 
            Sometimes, they get recreational media such as films and music. Students use libraries to study.
            Libraries help the students to develop good reading and study habits. 
            Public officials use libraries for research and public issues. 
            The libraries provide information and services that are essential for learning and progress.
